        <p>
          I just graduated from a frontend developer bootcamp in Ironhack. In
          the past, I have studied and worked in multimedia design, and now open
          to new horizons in the web development world. <br />
          I’m looking for a frontend position in a middle or small company that
          contributes to this society and where I can feel valued. I am open to
          continue learning new technologies and improving in JavaScript and VUE
          JS. I would appreciate being in contact with the design department so
          I can provide the knowledge and experience I already have.

            This is the first project done in Frontend IronHack Bootcamp after
            the first two weeks. The assignment was to duplicate a specific
            website, in this case the website was this one: circle. The project
            consisted in cloning the "main page", the "contact us" page and the
            "project page" and making it responsive for mobiles and desktop.
            Also we had to import the projects section information from a fake
            API.
